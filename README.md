#### Messing around with Unix/Python/Bash, etc
For a while now I've had my [toys repository](https://github.com/pfuntner/toys) for useful tools but I usually have a `$HOME/python/` directory where I experiment with things to get a better feel for features of a language.  I finally decided I need to put them in a repository so I can have these scripts everywhere and don't lose them.  In general they aren't really well-formed scripts.
